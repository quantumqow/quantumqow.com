Thanks to QQQ and BSidesPDX, you have the opportunity to crack an ATM safe!

In the contest room, you will find a Triton ATM with a combination lock on the safe, to which no one has the combination.  Your job, using non-destructive methods, is to figure out the combination!

We'll provide a USB boroscope, and there is already an access hole to see the back of the dial.  We'll also provide links to some videos showing how it's done... but the rest is up to you!

There will be prizes, at least for the first person to open the safe!

For more information or questions, stay tuned to this page; find @lokkju on wire; or just look for the blue ATM in the contest room.
